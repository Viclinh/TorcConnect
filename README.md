## Inspiration
Developers face many challenges when developing apps such as bugs, errors, knowledge challenges, etc. Thus, having a developer community where developers can connect and gain more knowledge or seek help is very important. Because of that, we would like to introduce TorcConnect, an app that provides a platform for developer community engagement and productivity tracking as well as boosting. 

The aim of TorcConnect is to build an engaged community for developers to seek help and connect with each other. TorcConnect also helps developers track productivity and manage their work. 

## What it does
- Developers can connect with other developers through live video chats. The video is live and users can talk directly with each other.
- We provide a platform to track the developers' productivity and assist them with managing their development work
- We provide chat forums about different programming languages so that developers can seek help and chat with others. 

## How we built it
 We built using Agora, Coda, HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript to develop the Chat Forum, Live Video Chat, and Productivity Tracking System. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to connect all different functions for the App

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build a productivity and boosting system, live video chat, and forum chat. 

## What we learned
We learnt about Agora, Coda and how to connect all those new technologies with what we have. 

## What's next for TorcConnect
We would like to add translation functions for the forum and add CC subtitles to the video.
